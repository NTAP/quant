# QUANT â€“ QUIC Userspace Accelerated Network Transfers

These are the beginnings of a BSD-licensed C11 implementation of
[QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic), the Google-originated proposal for a new
HTTP/2 transport over UDP. QUANT uses the
[warpcore](https://github.com/NTAP/warpcore) zero-copy  userspace UDP/IPv4 stack
on top of the [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) packet I/O
framework.

The quant repository is [on GitHub](https://github.com/NTAP/quant), as is
the [documentation](https://ntap.github.io/quant/).

We use [picotls](https://github.com/h2o/picotls) for its [TLS
1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/) implementation.
Picotls will be built automatically.


## Prerequisites

We use the [cmake](https://cmake.org/) build system.

We use [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) as a basis for the
event loop that underlies this implementation. The intent is that it will in the
end resemble something like what [libebb](http://tinyclouds.org/libebb/)
offers for HTTP/1.1 and TLS.

So you need to install some dependencies. On the Mac, the easiest way is via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), so install that first. Then, do

    brew install cmake libev http-parser doxygen

On Debian-based Linux systems, do

    apt install libev-dev libssl-dev libhttp-parser-dev libbsd-dev

On Darwin, you *must* also install the Xcode command line tools first:

    xcode-select --install


## Building
Warpcore uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) as a build system. To do an
out-of-source build of warpcore (best practice with `cmake`), do the following
to build with `make` as a generator:

    mkdir Debug
    cd Debug
    cmake ..
    make

The default build (per above) is without optimizations and with extensive debug
logging enabled. In order to build an optimized build, do this:

    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make


## Testing

The `libquant` library will be in `lib`. There are `client` and `server`
examples in `bin`.
