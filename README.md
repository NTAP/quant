# QUANT â€“ QUIC Userspace Accelerated Network Transfers

QUANT is a BSD-licensed C11 implementation of the emerging IETF
[QUIC](https://quicwg.github.io/) standard for a new
HTTP/2 transport over UDP. QUANT uses the
[warpcore](https://github.com/NTAP/warpcore) zero-copy  userspace UDP/IPv4 stack
on top of the [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) packet I/O
framework. It can also operate over the regular Socket API.

The quant repository is [on GitHub](https://github.com/NTAP/quant), as is
the [documentation](https://ntap.github.io/quant/).

We use [picotls](https://github.com/h2o/picotls) for its [TLS
1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/) implementation.
Picotls will be built automatically.


## Prerequisites

We use the [cmake](https://cmake.org/) build system.

We use [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) as a basis for the
event loop that underlies this implementation.

So you need to install some dependencies. On the Mac, the easiest way is via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), so install that first. Then, do

    brew install cmake libev http-parser doxygen

On Debian-based Linux systems, do

    apt install libev-dev libssl-dev libhttp-parser-dev libbsd-dev

On Darwin, you *must* also install the Xcode command line tools first:

    xcode-select --install


## Building
To do an
out-of-source build of warpcore (best practice with `cmake`), do the following
to build with `make` as a generator:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir Debug
    cd Debug
    cmake ..
    make

The default build (per above) is without optimizations and with extensive debug
logging enabled. In order to build an optimized build, do this:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make


## Docker container

Instead of building quant for yourself, you can also obtain a [pre-built Docker container]
(https://cloud.docker.com/u/ntap/repository/docker/ntap/quant/). For example,

    docker pull ntap/quant:latest

should download the latest build on the `master` branch. The docker container by default exposes a QUIC server on port 4433 that can serve `/index.html` and possibly other resources.

## Testing

The `libquant` library will be in `lib`. There are `client` and `server`
examples in `bin`. They explain their usage when called with a `-h` argument.

The current interop status of quant against [other
stacks](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations) is captured
in [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0tW89vOoaScs3IY9RGC0UesWGAwE6xyLk0l4JtvTVg/edit?usp=sharing).

At the moment, development happens in branches other than `master`, which are
numbered according to the [IETF Internet Drafts](https://quicwg.github.io/) they
implement. The `master` branch is updated whenever such a per-draft branch is
stable.


## Contributing

I'm happy to merge contributions that fix
[bugs](https://github.com/NTAP/quant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)
or add
[features](https://github.com/NTAP/quant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).
Please send pull requests.

(Contributions to the underlying [warpcore](https://github.com/NTAP/warpcore)
stack are also very welcome.)
